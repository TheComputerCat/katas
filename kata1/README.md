Run `npm install` and `npm test`. You can also run `npm run coverage` to see the coverage of the test.

Also you can run `make build` to build a docker to run the tests.

To run tests you have the following options:

1. `make test` to run tests once.
2. `make test-watch` to run test in watch mode.
3. `make test-coverage` to run test and show coverage stats.
4. `make test-bash` to run bash on alpine-node docker container.
